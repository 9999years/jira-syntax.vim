# jira-syntax.vim

**This plugin only contains support for JIRA formatting syntax; it does not
interact with the JIRA API in any way.**

[Atlassian JIRA] syntax support for Vim.

Install with [vim-plug], or whatever:

    Plug '9999years/jira-syntax.vim'

The syntax support is fine. It could probably be better.
